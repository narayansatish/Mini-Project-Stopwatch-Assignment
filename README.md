# Mini-Project-Stopwatch-Assignment-1

**Read these instructions carefully to understand the requirements and functionalities for this project.**

We will be Creating a Stopwatch using React for this Assignment.

### **Functionalities:**

Below Functionalities should be implemented in your Project:

- A **text element** to show count down timer in `( 00:00:00 ) â†’ HH:MM:SS` format.
- On `Start` button click, the timer will start.
- On `Reset` button click the timer will reset to 00:00:00.
- On `Pause` button click the timer will be paused.

### **Task 1: Project Set Up**

- Clone this repo by using [use template](https://github.com/frontbenchHQ/Mini-Project-Stopwatch-Assignment-1/generate) option with name of repo as `Mini-Project-Stopwatch-Assignment`.

- Clone your created repo and work on it to push your code.

- Use `githubbox.com` instead of `github.com` in your repository path, to create a synced codesandbox(always in sync with code in your repo). Read more [here](https://codesandbox.io/docs/importing#import-from-github)

### **Task 2: Project Requirements**

- [ ] Create a Component for timer with initial value for timer as `00:00:00`. Feel free to customise styles for it (Can be a simple `span` or `p` tag to display timer as well).
- [ ] Create 3 buttons i.e `Start`, `Pause` and `Reset`.
- [ ] Attach event handler to these 3 buttons.
- [ ] After attaching the event handler on buttons, first, check using a `console.log` statement that the buttons are working fine.
- [ ] Implement functionality for `Start` Button.
- [ ] Implement functionality for `Pause` Button.
- [ ] Implement functionality for `reset` Button.

**NOTE:** Use of **class component** is strictly `not allowed`.

### **Task 3**
